 - updated test.php to reflect changes
 
v0.3.1
 - Fixes a bug arising when calling empty on a property (it was always returning true)
 - updated test.php to reflect changes

v0.3.0
 - Complete refactoring to improve performance in most cases (Worst complexity is still the same)
 - Use of magical setter/getter to offload computation 
 - Implement JsonSerializable for back-compatibility with weird usage
 - Implement ArrayAccess for more fun ways to play with lists

v0.2.7
 - Implements Serializable (Useful in the case of the UserInterface in Silex)

v0.2.6
 - Bool (TinyInt) are not casted anymore to true/false because of a bug in PDO where false is binded to an empty string
   (they are casted to int instead)

v0.2.5
 - Int, Float, Bool are now casted from string according to MySQL type. May incur a ~10% loss in speed when using loadPile;
 - new getColumnsMeta in Manager
 - updated test.php to reflect changes

v0.2.4
 - Multiple database available (define const DB_NAME in class)
 - When using Silex/Symfony included ServiceProvider, DB_NAME is the name defined in dbs.conf
 - Default is usual comportment (base on $app['db'])
 - updated test.php to reflect changes

v0.2.3
 - Better consitency of data when loading partial objects
 - "null" from database are now loaded in object and are visible when using toArray

v0.2.2
 - Bug fix on 0.2.1 where fetchOne was poorly supported

v0.2.1 (DEPRECATED : UGRADE TO 0.2.2)
 - BREAKING CHANGE : in Entity, fetchOne and fetchAll now return empty object instead of null 
 > Fix : test $obj->isEmpty() instead of is_null($obj) in your conditions.

v0.2
 - throw an Exception when a unknow static function is invoked in manager (was failing with just a warning)
 - additional parameter to Manager->get() : default_values is dataloaded if object is new
 - additional parameter to toArray() : choose if _json columns are encoded (used internally for save only)
 - 'examples' directory added : some tests added to check basic functionnality
 - this CHANGELOG added
